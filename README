    MooseX::Interface - Java-style interfaces for Moose

SYNOPSIS
      package DatabaseAPI::ReadOnly
      {
        use MooseX::Interface;
        requires 'select';
      }
  
      package DatabaseAPI::ReadWrite
      {
        use MooseX::Interface;
        extends 'DatabaseAPI::ReadOnly';
        requires 'insert';
        requires 'update';
        requires 'delete';
      }
  
      package Database::MySQL
      {
        use Moose;
        with 'DatabaseAPI::ReadWrite';
        sub insert { ... }
        sub select { ... }
        sub update { ... }
        sub delete { ... }
      }

      Database::MySQL::->DOES('DatabaseAPI::ReadWrite');  # true

DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::Interface provides something similar to the concept of
    interfaces as found in many object-oriented programming languages like
    Java and PHP.

    "What?!" I hear you cry, "can't this already be done in Moose using
    roles?"

    Indeed it can, and that's precisely how MooseX::Interface works.
    Interfaces are just roles with a few additional restrictions:

    *   You may not define any methods within an interface, except:

        *   Moose's built-in "meta" method, which will be defined for you;

        *   You may override methods from UNIVERSAL; and

        *   You may define constants using the constant pragma.

    *   You may not define any attributes. (Attributes generate methods.)

    *   You may not define method modifiers.

    *   You can extend other interfaces, not normal roles.

  Functions
    "extends $interface"
        Extends an existing interface.

        Yes, the terminology "extends" is used rather than "with".

    "excludes $role"
        Prevents classes that implement this interface from also composing
        with this role.

    "requires $method"
        The name of a method (or attribute) that any classes implementing
        this interface *must* provide.

        A future version of MooseX::Interface may provide a way to declare
        method signatures.

    "const $name => $value"
        Experimental syntactic sugar for declaring constants. It's probably
        not a good idea to use this yet.
